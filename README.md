# Go URL Shortener

A simple URL shortening service written in Go that converts long URLs into short codes, stores them in a MySQL database or in memory, and provides redirection functionality.

## Purpose

This project was created as a learning exercise to practice and improve Go programming skills, including:

## Features

- HTTP server implementation.
- Working with databases using the database/sql package and MySQL driver.
- Uses mutex locks to ensure safe concurrent access to the data.
- URL validation and short code generation.
- Graceful server shutdown and signal handling.

## Requirements

- Go 1.19 or higher
- MySQL database
- Go MySQL driver (github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql)
